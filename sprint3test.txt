The system should allow an admin/receptionist to arrange a booking for a patient (selected from
the list of all patients) with their doctor by entering the date and time. If the doctor is not available
for the chosen date and time, the system should warn the admin/receptionist. Otherwise, the system
should then send confirmation messages to the patient and the doctor
